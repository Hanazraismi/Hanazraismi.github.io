        <h2>What is One Piece?</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eiichiro.oda/" target="_blank">  <img src="image/eiichiro.jpg" height="200px" width="250px"></a> <br>One Piece is a Japanese manga and anime series created by Eiichiro Oda. It was first serialized in 
            Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on July 22, 1997, and the anime adaptation followed shortly 
            thereafter. It has since become one of the most popular and long-running anime series of all time, 
            with millions of fans around the world. The series is known for its adventurous storyline, unique 
            characters, and deep lore.</p>

        <h2>Storyline</h2>
        <p>One Piece follows the adventures of <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b>, a young pirate with the dream of becoming 
            the Pirate King. Luffy sets out on a grand adventure to find the legendary treasure known as the 
            <i> One Piece</i> which is said to grant the title of Pirate King to its holder. Along the way, Luffy 
            forms a crew known as the Straw Hat Pirates, each member with their own dreams and unique abilities. 
            Together, they sail the seas, battle powerful enemies, and uncover the mysteries of the world.</p>
        <p>The story is set in a world divided by vast oceans and dangerous seas, known as the Grand Line. 
            Luffy and his crew face many challenges, including battling against rival pirate crews, the World 
            Government, and even ancient and powerful forces that threaten the balance of the world. As they 
            progress through the Grand Line, the Straw Hat Pirates uncover secrets about the world’s history, 
            Luffy’s mysterious Devil Fruit powers, and the true nature of the One Piece treasure.</p>
        <p> Luffy once said, <q>If you don’t take risks, you can’t create a future. -Monkey D Luffy</q></p>

After overcoming numerous challenges and enemies, they continue to navigate through islands like Skypiea, Water 7, and Enies Lobby, eventually reaching Sabaody Archipelago.</p>
